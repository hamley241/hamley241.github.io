Really fast.</p> <p>One week, we decided to build a dating feature backend. Tight deadline. High stakes. One week to ship.</p> <p>We launched it.</p> <p>Another time, we shipped <strong>India's first UPI payment feature on a chat messenger</strong> — before WhatsApp, before everyone else. Speed was our competitive advantage.</p> <p>Our philosophy? "Move fast, fix things later."</p> <p>And you know what? It worked. For that stage. For that pressure. For that competition.</p> <p>But it came at a cost.</p> <h2>The AWS Reality Check</h2> <p>When I joined AWS Lambda and then the BigMac (Amazon EC2 large fleet) team, the scale numbers stopped being impressive and started being terrifying:</p> <ul> <li>Over <strong>1 million instances</strong> under management</li> <li>Billions of requests processed daily</li> <li>A single wrong config could impact millions of customers</li> </ul> <p>Here, "move fast and fix things later" isn't bravery. It's negligence.</p> <p>At hyperscale, every shortcut compounds. Every "we'll fix it later" becomes "we're paying for this decision every day."</p> <p>I learned my first hard lesson: <strong>speed without reliability is just chaos waiting to happen.</strong></p> <h2>Lesson 1: Automation Isn't Optional — It's Survival</h2> <div class="highlight-box"> <h3>The 40-Minute Problem</h3> <p>When I started on the health systems team at AWS, incident response took 40 minutes from alert to full mitigation.</p> <p>Not because the engineers were slow. Not because they weren't talented. But because humans were in the critical path of every decision.</p> <p>Here's how it went:</p> <ol> <li>Alert fires (minute 0)</li> <li>On-call engineer wakes up (minute 5)</li> <li>Engineer assesses the situation (minute 15)</li> <li>Engineer decides on mitigation (minute 25)</li> <li>Engineer executes runbook (minute 35)</li> <li>System recovers (minute 40)</li> </ol> <p>40 minutes. Every step was reasonable. The process was the problem.</p> </div> <p>We asked: what if the system could decide <em>and</em> act?</p> <p>We built automated AZ weight-away systems with multi-signal detection, slow controlled responses, and built-in safeguards. The system could detect, decide, and mitigate — while keeping humans in the loop for oversight, not for execution.</p> <p><strong>The result: 40 minutes → 5 minutes.</strong></p> <p>Not because we worked faster. Because we worked smarter.</p> <h2>Lesson 2: "Works on My Machine" Doesn't Scale</h2> <p>At Hike, we'd often say "it works on my machine" and ship. At AWS, that's the first warning sign of a coming disaster.</p> <p>Here's the uncomfortable truth about scale:</p> <blockquote> What works for 1,000 instances will break at 100,000.<br> What works at 100,000 will break at 1,000,000. </blockquote> <p>Each order of magnitude exposes new failure modes. The hidden assumptions in your design become the obvious bottlenecks of tomorrow.</p> <p>At AWS, we design for the scale we haven't hit yet. We ask:</p> <ul> <li>What happens when this grows 10x?</li> <li>What's the blast radius if this fails?</li> <li>Can we roll back in seconds, not minutes?</li> </ul> <p>Scalability isn't about handling current load. It's about handling <em>future</em> load without redesign.</p> <h2>Lesson 3: The Best Feature Is the One Users Never Notice</h2> <p>In a startup, we celebrated launches. New features meant demos, screenshots, and press releases. <strong>Visibility is success.</strong></p> <p>At AWS, I learned something different:</p> <blockquote> The best infrastructure work is invisible. </blockquote> <p>Health systems, grey failure detection, automated recovery — users don't see these. But they feel it when they're missing.</p> <p>I remember the first time our automated health system caught a grey failure (a silent degradation) and mitigated it before any customer noticed. No alert. No pager. No incident report.</p> <p>Just logs showing the system protecting itself.</p> <p>That was better than any launch announcement.</p> <p><strong>Infrastructure work is user experience work, just at a different layer.</strong></p> <h2>Lesson 4: The Mindset Shift</h2> <p>Here's the summary of my entire journey:</p> <div class="highlight-box"> <table style="width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse;"> <tr> <td style="padding: 10px; border-bottom: 2px solid #18bc9c; font-weight: bold;">Startup Mindset</td> <td style="padding: 10px; border-bottom: 2px solid #18bc9c; font-weight: bold;">Hyperscale Mindset</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="padding: 10px; border-bottom: 1px solid #eee;">"How fast can we ship?"</td> <td style="padding: 10px; border-bottom: 1px solid #eee;">"How do we ship fast AND sleep at night?"</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="padding: 10px; border-bottom: 1px solid #eee;">Celebrate features</td> <td style="padding: 10px; border-bottom: 1px solid #eee;">Celebrate absence of incidents</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="padding: 10px; border-bottom: 1px solid #eee;">Fix on failure</td> <td style="padding: 10px; border-bottom: 1px solid #eee;">Prevent failure entirely</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="padding: 10px; border-bottom: 1px solid #eee;">Scale reactively</td> <td style="padding: 10px; border-bottom: 1px solid #eee;">Design proactively</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="padding: 10px;">Heroic firefighting</td> <td style="padding: 10px;">Boring operations (the best kind)</td> </tr> </table> </div> <p>Neither is wrong. Both matter. The best engineers know when to optimize for which.</p> <h2>What I Took With Me</h2> <p>Interestingly, my startup experience made me a better AWS engineer, and my AWS experience made me appreciate what startups accomplish.</p> <p>From Hike, I brought:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Product sense</strong> — understanding what users actually need, not just what the spec says</li> <li><strong>Ruthless prioritization</strong> — when everything is on fire, you learn to focus</li> <li><strong>The UPI experience</strong> — cross-functional coordination, regulatory compliance, building under ambiguity</li> </ul> <p>From AWS, I learned:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Data-driven decisions</strong> — opinions are cheap, metrics reveal truth</li> <li><strong>Automate or suffer</strong> — if you do it twice manually, you should automate it</li> <li><strong>Design for failure</strong> — assume everything will break, build accordingly</li> </ul> <h2>The Insight That Changed Everything</h2> <blockquote> Humans should design the response. Systems should execute it. </blockquote> <p>We went from "engineer follows runbook" to "engineer writes the automation that follows the runbook."</p> <p>Our job isn't to be fast at 3am. Our job is to make 3am incidents boring.</p> <p>That's the real difference I experienced moving from a startup to AWS. Not the tools. Not the processes. The mindset that <strong>reliability is a feature</strong>, not an afterthought.</p> <h2>Conclusion: Two Worlds, One Goal</h2> <p>Whether you're shipping a dating feature in a week at a startup or protecting a million-instance fleet at AWS, the goal is the same: <strong>create value for users</strong>.</p> <p>The startup taught me speed and creativity.<br> AWS taught me reliability and scale.</p> <p>Both matter. The magic is knowing when to trade speed for reliability, and when reliability enables even greater speed.</p> <p>The engineers who master both? They're the ones who build things that matter.</p> <hr> <p><em>What have you learned moving between different company stages or engineering cultures?
