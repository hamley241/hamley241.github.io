    "prompt": "A professional technical illustration of 'Grey Failure' in distributed systems. Split composition: left side shows a clean monitoring dashboard with green checkmarks and healthy server icons, right side shows frustrated users with error messages and slow loading spinners. In the center, a large gradient zone transitioning from green to yellow to grey to red, representing the spectrum from healthy to failed. The grey zone is prominent and labeled, showing the dangerous middle ground where health checks pass but users suffer. Clean, modern tech aesthetic with flat design, soft shadows, minimal text labels like 'HEALTH CHECKS' and 'USER EXPERIENCE'. Professional blog header style, dark navy and slate color palette with accent colors.",
